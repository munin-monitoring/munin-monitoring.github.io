			<h2>About support</h2>
			<p>To ensure proper response and not only guesswork, please include any relevant configuration files and/or
				environment files. It also helps if you include output from any debugging sessions (see
				<a href="http://guide.munin-monitoring.org/en/latest/tutorial/troubleshooting.html">Debugging Munin</a> and
				<a href="http://guide.munin-monitoring.org/en/latest/tutorial/troubleshooting.html#debugging-plugins">Debugging Munin plugins</a>) where
				applicable. Also include relevant information like what operating system is in use, distribution if
				applicable, and whether you use SELinux or something similar. Too much information is better than too
				little information.</p>

			<p>If you have problems with a plugin that is not included in the Munin distribution, you must explain where you found it.</p>

			<p>If you don't want to disclose your organization's host names or IP scheme, feel free to obfuscate the
				config files as long as you do it consistently, i.e. replace oracle1.somecompany.com with host1.example.com
				and oracle2.somecompany.com with host2.example.com and so on. BUT! If you do so it may actually be harder
				to answer your question because making the replacement is another source of errors.</p>

			<p>Always remember that the quality of the answer is strongly correlated to the quality of the question. If
				you are not precise when asking questions, you will not get precise answers. This may be summed up with
				the familiar expression "Garbage in, garbage out".</p>
