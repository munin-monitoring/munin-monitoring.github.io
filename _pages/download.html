			<h1>Download munin</h1>

			<p class="note note-warning"><i class="mdi mdi-information"></i> We strongly recommend a packaged install, as the source
				distribution isn’t as tested as the packaged one. The current state of the packages is so satisfactory,
				that even the developers use them instead.</p>

			<h2><i class="mdi mdi-package-down"></i> From packages</h2>
			<h3>Installation</h3>

			<p>You will have to install the <code>munin-node</code> package on each node you want to monitor, and
				<code>munin</code> on the master. Example instructions for Ubuntu / Debian:</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<h4>On each node</h4>

					<div class="console">
						<div class="prompt">user@node01:~$</div><div class="command">sudo apt-get install munin-node</div>
						<div class="command-output">
							[sudo] password for user:<br />
							Reading package lists... Done<br />
							Building dependency tree<br />
							Reading state information... Done<br />
							The following extra packages will be installed:
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<h4>On the master</h4>

					<div class="console">
						<div class="prompt">user@master:~$</div><div class="command">sudo apt-get install munin</div>
						<div class="command-output">
							[sudo] password for user:<br />
							Reading package lists... Done<br />
							Building dependency tree<br />
							Reading state information... Done<br />
							The following extra packages will be installed:
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p class="note"><i class="mdi mdi-information"></i> Please note that this might not be the latest version of Munin.
				On Debian you have the option of enabling “backports”, which may give access to later versions of Munin.</p>
			<br />

			<h3>Configuration</h3>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<h4>On each node</h4>
					<p>The munin node listens on all interfaces by default, but has a restrictive access list. You need
						to add your master’s IP address.</p>

					<div class="conf-file">
						<div class="filename"># /etc/munin/munin-node.conf</div>
						<div class="conf-before">
							# A list of addresses that are allowed to connect.  This must be a<br />
							# regular expression, since Net::Server does not understand CIDR-style<br />
							# network notation unless the perl module Net::CIDR is installed.  You<br />
							# may repeat the allow line as many times as you'd like
						</div>
						<div class="conf">
							allow ‘^127.’<br />
							allow ‘^192.0.2.1$’
						</div>
						<div class="conf-after">
							# If you have installed the Net::CIDR perl module, you can use one or more<br />
							# cidr_allow and cidr_deny address/mask patterns.  A connecting client must<br />
							# match any cidr_allow, and not match any cidr_deny.  Note that a netmask
						</div>
					</div>

					<p>Start munin-node service, or restart it if it was already started:</p>
					<div class="console">
						<div class="prompt">user@node01:~$</div><div class="command">sudo service munin-node restart</div>
						<div class="command-output">
							[ ok ] Stopping Munin-Node: done.<br />
							[ ok ] Starting Munin-Node: done.
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<h4>On the master</h4>
					<p>Add the previously configured nodes to the master configuration file:</p>

					<div class="conf-file">
						<div class="filename"># /etc/munin/munin.conf</div>
						<div class="conf-before">
							# a simple host tree
						</div>
						<div class="conf">
							[node01.example.com]<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;address 192.0.2.4<br />
							<br />
							[node02.example.com]<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;address node02.example.com<br />
							<br />
							[node03.example.com]<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;address 2001:db8::de:caf:bad<br />
						</div>
						<div class="conf-after">
							#<br />
							# A more complex example of a host tree<br />
							#<br />
							## First our "normal" host.<br />
							# [fii.foo.com]<br />
						</div>
					</div>

					<p>The master service does not need to be reloaded: its configuration file will be read on the next poll.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<br />
			<p>
				Now that munin is up and running, you can view report pages in your browser (munin 2.0: <code>http://localhost/munin/</code> / munin 3.0: <code>http://localhost:4948/</code>).
				You may have to wait up to 5 minutes until nodes gets polled and data goes live on the report pages.
