			<h2>What is Munin?</h2>
			<p>Munin is a networked resource monitoring tool that can help analyze resource trends and "what just happened
				to kill our performance?" problems. It is designed to be very plug and play. A default installation provides
				a lot of graphs with almost no work.</p>
			<p>In Norse mythology Hugin and Munin are the ravens of the god king Odin. They flew all over Midgard for him,
				seeing and remembering, and later telling him. "Munin" means "memory".</p>

			<h2>How does it work?</h2>

			<p>Munin the monitoring tool surveys all your computers and remembers what it saw. It presents all the
				information in graphs through a web interface. Its emphasis is on plug and play capabilities. After
				completing an installation, a high number of monitoring plugins will be playing with no more effort.</p>

			<p>Using Munin you can easily monitor the performance of your computers, networks, SANs, applications,
				weather measurements and whatever comes to mind. It makes it easy to determine "what's different today"
				when a performance problem crops up. It makes it easy to see how you're doing capacity-wise on any resources.</p>

			<p>Munin uses the excellent <a href="https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/">​RRDTool</a> (written
				by Tobi Oetiker) and the framework is written in Perl, while plugins may be written in any language.
				Munin has a master/node architecture in which the master connects to all the nodes at regular intervals
				and asks them for data. It then stores the data in RRD files, and (if needed) updates the graphs. One of
				the main goals has been ease of creating new plugins (graphs).</p>

			<h3>Plugins</h3>
			<p>Plugins are small, standalone executables. They are easy to write, and can be written in any language.
				You can find many user contributed plugins in ​the <a href="https://github.com/munin-monitoring/contrib/">contrib</a> repository
				or <a href="https://guide.munin-monitoring.org/en/latest/plugin/index.html">easily write your own ones</a>.</p>
