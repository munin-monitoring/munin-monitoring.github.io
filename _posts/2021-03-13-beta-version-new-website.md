Our new website is currently moving from Trac to [Github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll), 
powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). 

Many wiki pages are removed, since they are totally obsolete, and are replaced by 

* [The Munin Guide](http://guide.munin-monitoring.org) for the documentation part of the wiki
* A direct link to [our repository in GitHub](https://github.com/munin-monitoring/munin) for the source part.

The remaining things are the downloads & the gallery. Those don't have a replacement yet. 

The Beta version is accessible at [https://www.munin-monitoring.org/](https://www.munin-monitoring.org/).
